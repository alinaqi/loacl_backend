# Simplification and Refactoring TODO List

## Architecture Simplification

[ ] Remove dependency injection pattern and simplify to direct imports
[ ] Consolidate database connection to a single global instance
[ ] Remove service layer and merge business logic into route handlers
[ ] Simplify error handling to use FastAPI's built-in exception handlers
[ ] Remove repositories layer and use direct database queries
[ ] Consolidate all database models into a single models.py file
[ ] Move all routes into a single router file for simplicity
[ ] Remove complex configuration management and use simple environment variables

## Code Organization

[ ] Flatten directory structure to remove unnecessary nesting
[ ] Merge similar functionality into single files
[ ] Remove unnecessary abstractions and interfaces
[ ] Consolidate utility functions into a single utils.py
[ ] Remove redundant type definitions and simplify to basic types
[ ] Simplify logging to use FastAPI's default logger
[ ] Remove custom middleware and use FastAPI defaults where possible

## Proposed New Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py           # FastAPI app and route handlers
│   ├── models.py         # All Pydantic and database models
│   ├── database.py       # Database connection and queries
│   ├── utils.py          # Utility functions
│   └── config.py         # Simple environment configuration
├── tests/                # Simplified test structure
└── requirements.txt      # Direct dependencies only
```

## Database Simplification

[ ] Remove complex database session management
[ ] Simplify database queries to use raw SQL or basic ORM queries
[ ] Remove transaction management complexity
[ ] Consolidate database migrations into a single file
[ ] Remove complex relationship mappings

## API Simplification

[ ] Simplify response models to basic dictionaries where possible
[ ] Remove complex validation layers
[ ] Simplify authentication to use basic JWT or API key
[ ] Remove complex request/response transformations
[ ] Consolidate similar endpoints
[ ] Remove redundant CRUD operations

## Testing Simplification

[ ] Remove complex test fixtures
[ ] Simplify mocking strategy
[ ] Remove unnecessary test abstractions
[ ] Consolidate similar tests
[ ] Remove integration tests in favor of simple unit tests

## Documentation Updates

[ ] Update API documentation to reflect simplified structure
[ ] Remove complex setup instructions
[ ] Simplify deployment documentation
[ ] Update environment variable documentation
[ ] Remove unnecessary configuration documentation

## Cleanup Tasks

[ ] Remove unused dependencies from requirements.txt
[ ] Remove unnecessary configuration files
[ ] Clean up unused imports
[ ] Remove deprecated code
[ ] Update README with simplified setup instructions

## Performance Optimization

[ ] Remove unnecessary async/await patterns where not needed
[ ] Simplify database queries for better performance
[ ] Remove redundant data transformations
[ ] Optimize route handlers for common operations

Remember to mark tasks as [x] when completed.

Note: This refactoring aims to simplify the architecture while maintaining functionality. The goal is to reduce complexity and make the codebase more maintainable without sacrificing essential features.
